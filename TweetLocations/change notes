adding the scoring concept
made the mapview setup call the non-mapview setup first, was having some things where two mapviews from the collectionview would cause the pic size to permanently be smaller forever.  Sigh.  It's a hack.
    -- still can be wrong
Added the possibility for the partialSet2Read to do by user or by size.  Right now it can kill the user, or it will drop everything below 899 size of pic (if it has a pic).  It dropping by pic value, it will not drop things if it finds a video file.
Fixed the bad scoreForUser that was getting reported when dropping from all lists
keeping the userscore in the tweet
and sorting by: (picSize, ID) now
not sorting by hasBeenRead, that was annoying
also, not grabbing a list automatically, perhaps there are things to do first?
fixed a lockup condition where the queue being deleted in the foreground was flonky
    moved it to a buncha background queue deletes, ugh
grabbing the first tweet upon startup
was messing with the scroll scale, still not allowing it to be quite big enuf
made the prevTweet obey the actual previsouly viewed tweet
