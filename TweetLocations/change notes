altered the sorting of links to get the big tumblr pics at top
fixed an if statement that wasn't grabbing the best tumblr for replacement
also fixed some "replacement" algorithms that were checking the url instead of the str of the pic
added the replacement for "nothing found ? try the topmost link."
trying to make the collectionview transparent-background
also making the collectionview ordered, because it should keep the same order as the links
and made the scrollview able to get bigger than 5x (10x now) for long collected images

bad:
There's a pretty big issue with clicking the links in the text background. grrr
