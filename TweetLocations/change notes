making it ask for google grab, if google is not enabled
Google sucks right now, not getting the subcription list right - working on it
   Also adding the operations for each subscription to return the items
   not doing anything with the items right now, just finding them (unread only)
also making the detail view autodrop the translucent status frame
Working on the DetailController to make it threadsafe while fetching images
    this requires going into the web thread, which then kicks back into the mainqueue
    also doing the same for collection pictures
    and there's a delete-image-queue operation thing that works the same
Changing the tweet delete to: 
    500-600 if not LOC and not FAV and not READ
    600+ if not READ
