ios7 - having to move some things around
trying to stop the selection in the edit-text, but keep the long-press action - done
trying to help out the sorting mechanism and simplify it
got the vine links, can see still frame, handling the video
Also added the username as default for filename in save video
Made the video preview a whole other webview controller, seems to work
