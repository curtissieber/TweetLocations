Making the "gets" into three parts.  Timeline, lists, and otherLists (other account)
I think the lists are stymied by the other gets, as far as maxid goes.
- fixed that, I think.  all lists are remembering themselves well
- dropped some link checking in web view to see if that helps memory
- made some limits for disk and memory image caching
