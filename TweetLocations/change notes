made the buttons smaller and more hidden(ish)
it wasn't queueing the regrabbing of images if they were deleted
Checks to see if all images are deleted when they're deleted

WISHLIST:
and can I figure out vine links? someday perhaps
and having trouble with google things that have the pic in the content not the url
