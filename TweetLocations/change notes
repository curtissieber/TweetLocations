upsized the transparent info text item (STATUS)
Changed the detail big text view to be [user]: text
fixed the task increment for googleOperations
made the googleOperations work on subscription arrays
    and only queue the tweetgrabber after all subscriptions
    have sorted the queue of tweetgrabbers
gave up the idea of dropping images during backgrounder in AppDelegate
    also made it await the completion of all tasks
Trying to fix the setRead in the GoogleOperations
Now I have googleID and streamID in the DB
found out I was only grabbing 20 from each stream -- now 2000
Made the status item in the master view float above the items
