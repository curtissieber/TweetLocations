*added the sourceDict from the item into the info box for the item
*made the detail view do a bunch different threads for pics, hopefully less "locky"
*keeping track of collectionPics in the readPics set, instead of always deleting them
*broke up the refresh into twitter/google choice

WISHLIST:
too many images die saving themseleves - only grab 100 Google things each time
still need better recognition of pinterest things
    probably rework the whole link processing
and the movie links only arrive from a refresh?
and can I figure out vine links? someday perhaps
and having trouble with google things that have the pic in the content not the url
