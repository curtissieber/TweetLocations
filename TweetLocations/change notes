added pinimg.com to the recognized and replace lists
    tried to make the tumblr.com previews be at the top
    and the instragram recogizes instagr.am and instragram.com
    also mobli.com media_ files
    for replaces, tried to allow .com/post/ to catch the odd tumblrs that are self-named
and a bunch of tiny shifts of things on the detail view layout

WISHLIST:
too many images die saving themseleves - only grab 100 Google things each time
and can I figure out vine links? someday perhaps
and having trouble with google things that have the pic in the content not the url
